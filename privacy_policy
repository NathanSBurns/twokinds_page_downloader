This is for my own personal use, but facebook requires a privacy policy url so here you go!
By using this app, you give yourself the permission to upload the TwoKinds comic update.
Other privacy permissions will be provided at the descression of the user.
The Autor (Nathan Burns) has the right to change the permissions if he wishes.
Zuck wants the suck.
